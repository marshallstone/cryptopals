# Crytopals Challenges
These challenges are taken from [cryptopals](cryptopals.com).

I am doing these challenges to get better at writing in C as well as learning more about cryptography.


## Challenges
Set 1: Basics
[x] - Convert hex to base64
[ ] - Fixed XOR
[ ] - Single-byte XOR cipher
[ ] - Detect single-character XOR
[ ] - Implement repeating-key XOR
[ ] - Break repeating-key XOR
[ ] - AES in ECB mode
[ ] - Detect AES in ECB mode
